    # either of the two following requirements can be included and accepted:
    # 1. "Built on Flow": You need to clearly state in the README.md that it is built on Flow, and
    #    if there are any contracts, list the contract addresses deployed on Flow.
    # 2. With Flow components: Cadence Language, or with `@onflow/fcl` or `@onflow/kit`(in package.json), or using
    #    go sdk(url in go.mod), or with Flow public EVM endpoints set(in Solidity configure files).
